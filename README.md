# Expected bias: quantifying and correcting for publication bias
Repository for code to replicate experiments from my master thesis: "Expected bias: quantifying and correcting for publication bias". The R markdown file contains all five experiments conducted for the thesis, while the file nct.cpp contains functions written in C++ and ported to R via the Rcpp library.
